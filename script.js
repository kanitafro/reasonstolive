    testimonial: "I saw a person on the sidewalk stopping to take pictures of the blossomed trees. Made me smile wide. I love seeing people find beauty in nature, I love seeing people appreciate it and not being afraid to stop and appreciate it. This is something I had to learn over the past couple of years or so. Slow down, there's no shame in stopping to appreciate life. My camera roll is full of close-ups of blossoms, colorful weed, and many kinds of flowers â€“ those that I can recognize and those that I'm not able to name in a million years but I appreciate them the same nevertheless. I love these rare moments in which the world feels like a nice place when most of the time it's evil beyond comprehension."
